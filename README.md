# Quiz-app

## Purpose of the app
The main motivation behind building Quizzly is to get practical experience with Express.js communication, MongoDB databases, linking front and back ends, and user authentication. 

## Mechanism
The questions along with relevant details will be hosted on the MongoDB database, and the React front-end will access them through Express. User authentication will help store high scores and history.

## Status
The servers, database, and communication have been set up. Only the questions need to be uploaded to MongoDB and the React end needs to be finalized to host the QA interface. Both front-end and back-end can be launched with the same command "npm start" from their respective directories.
